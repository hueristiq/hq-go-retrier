// validBounds reports whether the delay bounds handed to a constructor are usable: both

// Parameters:
//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.

//
// Returns:
//   - valid (bool): True when minDelay and maxDelay are positive and minDelay does not exceed

// The base delay grows as minDelay * 2^attempt and is capped at maxDelay. Overflow is guarded by
// checking against math.MaxInt64/2 before doubling and by capping as soon as the next doubling
// would exceed maxDelay. It is the shared core used by all exponential strategies in this package.
//
// Callers must guarantee valid input — positive, ordered bounds and a non-negative attempt; the
// constructors in this package enforce this before calling it.
//
// Parameters:
//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.
//   - maxDelay (time.Duration): The maximum allowable delay duration.
//   - attempt (int): The current retry attempt number (typically starting at 1).

//   - base (time.Duration): The exponential base delay, capped at maxDelay.

// Exponential returns a Backoff function that implements a basic exponential backoff strategy.

// This strategy calculates the delay by exponentially increasing the base delay (minDelay) based on

//
//	delay = min(maxDelay, minDelay * 2^attempt)
//
// The delay is capped at maxDelay to ensure reasonable retry intervals. If minDelay or maxDelay is
// less than or equal to 0 or minDelay exceeds maxDelay, the returned Backoff always yields a zero
// duration. A negative attempt also yields zero.
//
// Parameters:
//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.
//   - maxDelay (time.Duration): The maximum allowable delay duration.
//
// Returns:
//   - backoff (Backoff): A function that computes the exponential backoff delay for a given attempt,
//     capped at maxDelay.

// If minDelay or maxDelay is less than or equal to 0 or minDelay exceeds maxDelay, the returned

// Parameters:
//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.
//   - maxDelay (time.Duration): The maximum allowable delay duration.

//
// The exponential base is computed as min(maxDelay, minDelay * 2^attempt), then full jitter is
// applied via jitter.Full, yielding a delay in the range [0, base):
//
//	delay = jitter.Full(min(maxDelay, minDelay * 2^attempt))

//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.

// ExponentialWithDecorrelatedJitter returns a Backoff function that implements exponential backoff
// with decorrelated jitter, reducing correlation between successive retry delays.
//
// Each delay is drawn from the range [minDelay, min(maxDelay, previous * 3)], where previous is
// the delay produced by the preceding call — not a fixed function of the attempt number:
//
//	delay = jitter.Decorrelated(minDelay, maxDelay, previousDelay)
//
// Because every draw depends on the previous random draw, successive waits are decorrelated in
// the sense of the AWS Architecture Blog's "decorrelated jitter": a run of short waits is not
// followed predictably by another short wait, which spreads retries of many clients over time.
//
// The returned function is stateful: it remembers the last delay it produced and starts from
// minDelay. It is safe for concurrent use, but all callers of a shared instance contribute to
// one delay sequence — construct one instance per retry loop for independent decorrelation, which
// Retry and RetryWithData do automatically when this constructor is passed to WithRetryBackoff.
// The attempt parameter is validated but otherwise unused; growth is driven by the previous delay.
//
// If minDelay or maxDelay is less than or equal to 0 or minDelay exceeds maxDelay, the returned
// Backoff always yields a zero duration. A negative attempt also yields zero.
//
// Parameters:
//   - minDelay (time.Duration): The base (minimum) delay duration.
//   - maxDelay (time.Duration): The maximum allowable delay duration.
//
// Returns:
//   - backoff (Backoff): A function that computes the exponential backoff delay with decorrelated jitter
//     for a given attempt, never exceeding maxDelay.
