## Code Style

This package follows the shared code-style conventions of the hueristiq Go libraries:

- **Documentation.** Every exported symbol carries a doc comment that begins with the symbol name. Functions document their parameters and results under `Parameters:` and `Returns:` headings as `  - name (type): description` lists, and use named return parameters.
- **Errors.** Error strings are lowercase, carry no trailing punctuation, and are prefixed with the producing function (for example `package.Func: message`). Sentinel errors live in package-level vars; underlying errors are wrapped with `%w`.
- **Configuration.** Functional options named `WithX` over an unexported options struct are the default; a config struct or fluent builder is used where it fits the domain better.
- **Interfaces.** A type that implements an interface declares a compile-time assertion (`var _ Iface = (*T)(nil)`).
- **Naming.** MixedCaps with uniform-case initialisms (`URL`, `ID`, `TLS`); accessors are not prefixed with `Get`.
- **Formatting.** Code is `gofmt`/`goimports` clean, with imports grouped standard library / external / `github.com/hueristiq`. Style is enforced mechanically by the repo-pinned `golangci-lint` configuration — run `make go-lint` before submitting.
