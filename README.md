## Features

- **Configurable Retry Policy:** Max attempts, min/max delays, and backoff strategy.
- **Context Support:** Cancellation and deadlines are observed during attempts and waits.
- **Result-Carrying Operations:** `RetryWithData` retries operations that return a value.
- **Non-Retryable Errors:** The `WithRetryOn` predicate stops the loop on failures retry cannot fix.
- **Notifier Callback:** Fires after each retried failure with the attempt, error, and next delay.
- **Backoff and Jitter Strategies:** Exponential backoff with equal, full, or decorrelated jitter.

## Installation

To install `hq-lib-retrier-go`, run the following command in your Go project:

```bash
go get -v -u github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go
```

## Usage

The examples below import the package under the `hqgoretrier` alias.

```go
import hqgoretrier "github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go"
```

### Basic Retry

Use `Retry` for operations that return only an error, such as network requests or file operations:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	hqgoretrier "github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go"
	hqgoretrierbackoff "github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go/backoff"
)

func main() {
	attempts := 0

	operation := func() error {
		attempts++

		if attempts < 3 {
			return fmt.Errorf("temporary failure (attempt %d)", attempts)
		}

		return nil
	}

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)

	defer cancel()

	err := hqgoretrier.Retry(ctx, operation,
		hqgoretrier.WithMaxAttempts(5),
		hqgoretrier.WithWaitMin(100*time.Millisecond),
		hqgoretrier.WithWaitMax(2*time.Second),
		hqgoretrier.WithBackoff(hqgoretrierbackoff.ExponentialWithFullJitter),
		hqgoretrier.WithNotifier(func(attempt int, err error, next time.Duration) {
			fmt.Printf("Attempt %d failed: %v. Next attempt in %v.\n", attempt, err, next)
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Operation failed after retries: %v\n", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Operation succeeded!")
	}
}
```

### Retry With Data

Use `RetryWithData` for operations that return both a result and an error, such as fetching data from an API. The result type is inferred from the operation, so no type assertions are needed:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	hqgoretrier "github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go"
	hqgoretrierbackoff "github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go/backoff"
)

func main() {
	attempts := 0

	fetchData := func() (string, error) {
		attempts++

		if attempts < 2 {
			return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to fetch data (attempt %d)", attempts)
		}

		return "payload", nil
	}

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)

	defer cancel()

	result, err := hqgoretrier.RetryWithData(ctx, fetchData,
		hqgoretrier.WithMaxAttempts(5),
		hqgoretrier.WithWaitMin(200*time.Millisecond),
		hqgoretrier.WithWaitMax(3*time.Second),
		hqgoretrier.WithBackoff(hqgoretrierbackoff.Exponential),
		hqgoretrier.WithNotifier(func(attempt int, err error, next time.Duration) {
			fmt.Printf("Attempt %d failed: %v, waiting %v.\n", attempt, err, next)
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to fetch data after retries: %v\n", err)

		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Data fetched successfully: %s\n", result)
}
```

### Non-Retryable Errors

Not every failure deserves another attempt — a `400 Bad Request` fails the same way every time. `WithRetryOn(fn)` classifies errors after each failed attempt; when it returns `false`, the retry loop stops immediately and returns the offending error instead of scheduling the next one:

```go
err := hqgoretrier.Retry(ctx, operation,
	hqgoretrier.WithRetryOn(func(err error) bool {
		return !errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) // missing rows are not worth retrying
	}),
)
```

## Configuration

Behavior is set through functional options passed to `Retry` or `RetryWithData`. Any option left unset falls back to its default.

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WithMaxAttempts(n)` | Maximum number of attempts, **including the initial call** (so `3` means the first call plus up to two retries). A value `<= 0` falls back to the default; pass `math.MaxInt` for effectively unbounded retries bounded only by the context. | `DefaultMaxAttempts` (`3`) |
| `WithWaitMin(d)` | Lower bound for the delay between attempts. A value `<= 0` falls back to the default. | `DefaultWaitMin` (`1s`) |
| `WithWaitMax(d)` | Upper bound for the delay between attempts. A value `<= 0` falls back to the default; a value below the minimum is raised to the minimum. | `DefaultWaitMax` (`30s`) |
| `WithBackoff(fn)` | Constructor for the strategy that computes each delay (see below). It is called once per retry loop with the normalized bounds, so stateful strategies always get fresh state. Passing `nil` selects the default. | `backoff.ExponentialWithDecorrelatedJitter` |
| `WithRetryOn(fn)` | Predicate deciding whether a failed attempt's error is retryable; returning `false` stops retrying and returns that error. | retry all errors |
| `WithNotifier(fn)` | Callback invoked after each failed attempt that will be retried, receiving the attempt number, the error, and the next delay. | none |

Invalid values are normalized before the first attempt, and any non-positive delay a strategy computes is clamped to a 1 ms floor, so the retry loop never spins at full CPU.

## Backoff & Jitter Strategies

The delay between attempts is produced by a `backoff.Backoff` function — `func(attempt int) (delay time.Duration)`. Constructors take the delay bounds and return the ready-to-use strategy; the retrier calls the constructor once per retry loop with the normalized bounds, so stateful strategies always see fresh per-loop state. The `backoff` package provides exponential strategies, where the base delay grows as `min(maxDelay, minDelay * 2^attempt)`. Jitter adds randomness so that clients which failed together do not retry in lockstep.

| Strategy | Delay range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Exponential(min, max)` | `base` | Deterministic; no jitter. |
| `ExponentialWithEqualJitter(min, max)` | `[base/2, base)` | Half the delay is fixed, half is random. |
| `ExponentialWithFullJitter(min, max)` | `[0, base)` | Fully randomized; spreads retries most aggressively. |
| `ExponentialWithDecorrelatedJitter(min, max)` | `[min, min(max, previous*3))` | Default; decouples successive delays. Stateful. |

Here `base` is `min(maxDelay, minDelay * 2^attempt)` and `previous` is the delay the strategy produced on its preceding call — the decorrelated strategy remembers its last delay, so each draw depends on the previous random draw (true decorrelated jitter). It is safe for concurrent use. All strategies guard against integer overflow and produce a zero duration for invalid input (a constructor called with non-positive bounds or a minimum above the maximum, or a negative attempt).

The jitter functions are also exported directly from the [`jitter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hueristiq/hq-lib-retrier-go/jitter) package for building custom strategies. To implement your own, pass a constructor to `WithBackoff`:

```go
hqgoretrier.WithBackoff(func(minDelay, maxDelay time.Duration) hqgoretrierbackoff.Backoff {
	return func(attempt int) time.Duration {
		return minDelay // constant backoff
	}
})
```
